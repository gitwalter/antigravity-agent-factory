# Execute onboarding
python cli/factory_cli.py --onboard C:\Projects\my-existing-repo
```

Or in Cursor chat:

```
Please onboard my existing repository at C:\Projects\my-existing-repo
```

See **ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md** for full details.

## Understanding Blueprints

Blueprints are pre-configured technology stacks that define your AI agent system. During onboarding, you'll select or be matched to a blueprint based on your technology choices.

**27 blueprints available** across categories:
- **Python**: FastAPI, Streamlit, ML/AI, RAG, Multi-Agent
- **TypeScript**: React, Next.js
- **JVM**: Java Spring, Kotlin Spring
- **Enterprise**: C# .NET, SAP (ABAP, RAP, CAP, CPI)
- **Web3**: Solidity, Solana Rust, DeFi
- **Automation**: n8n

See **Blueprints Reference** for detailed specifications.

---

## Understanding Value Propagation

Every generated project receives **4 layers of value** that provide ongoing capabilities beyond the initial generation. These layers ensure your project continues to benefit from Factory innovations even after onboarding.

| Layer | Name | What It Does | Commands |
|-------|------|--------------|----------|
| Layer 0 | Foundation | Verifies AI outputs, prevents hallucinations | "Verify this claim" |
| Layer 1 | Development Autonomy | Self-healing CI/CD, automatic debugging | "Monitor CI pipeline", "Fix pipeline errors" |
| Layer 2 | Knowledge Independence | Extend knowledge without Factory updates | "Extend knowledge for [topic]" |
| Layer 3 | PM Integration | Project management (opt-in) | "Create a story", "Plan sprint" |

### Layer 0: Foundation

**Automatic** - Included in every project

The Foundation layer provides integrity verification and hallucination prevention. The Integrity Guardian monitors all AI operations for axiom alignment and factual accuracy. This layer ensures that AI-generated code and documentation meet quality standards and align with your project's values.

**Try it:** Say `"Verify this claim"` when reviewing AI-generated code or documentation.

### Layer 1: Development Autonomy

**Automatic** - Included in every project

Development Autonomy enables self-healing CI/CD pipelines and automatic error detection. Your project can monitor its own CI/CD status, detect failures, and automatically fix common pipeline issues without manual intervention.

**Try it:**
- `"Monitor CI pipeline"` - Set up continuous monitoring
- `"Fix pipeline errors"` - Automatically diagnose and fix CI/CD failures

### Layer 2: Knowledge Independence

**Automatic** - Included in every project

Knowledge Independence allows your project to extend its own knowledge base without requiring Factory updates. You can add domain-specific knowledge, patterns, and best practices that become part of your project's permanent knowledge system.

**Try it:** `"Extend knowledge for [topic]"` - Add new domain knowledge that agents can reference

### Layer 3: PM Integration

**Opt-in** - Available when configured during onboarding

PM Integration connects your project to project management systems (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, etc.) and provides skills for creating stories, planning sprints, tracking burndown, and managing team workflows.

**Try it:**
- `"Create a story"` - Generate user stories with acceptance criteria
- `"Plan sprint"` - Pull stories into a sprint with capacity planning
- `"Run standup"` - Generate standup reports from current work

### Getting Started with Value Propagation

- **Layers 0-2 are automatic** - They're included in every generated project and work immediately
- **Layer 3 requires configuration** - Enable PM integration during onboarding or configure it later using the PM configuration skill
- **See **generated-output.md**** for complete details on all generated capabilities

## Upgrading Your Path

Started solo and now have a team? You can upgrade your setup.

### Express Lane to Team Huddle

If you completed Express Lane individually and now want team alignment:

1. Keep your generated project as-is
2. Run Team Huddle with your team
3. The huddle will enhance (not replace) your existing artifacts
4. Team values and wisdom merge with your individual setup

```
We completed Express Lane. Now we want to run Team Huddle to align as a team.
```

### Team Huddle to Workshop Series

For deeper alignment after a successful huddle:

1. Your huddle outputs become input for the workshops
2. Vision Quest can expand on your `TEAM_CHARTER.md`
3. Ethics Arena deepens the values you voted on
4. Run individual workshops as needed - you don't have to do all 5

```
We did Team Huddle last week. Now we want to run the Ethics Arena workshop.
```

## Philosophy

> "All being and doing is grounded in Love, Truth, and Beauty." — Axiom 0

Every onboarding path is designed to capture not just *what* you're building, but *why* it matters and *who* you are as a team. The technical artifacts are important, but the spirit you bring to the work is what makes the difference.

---

## The Integrity Guardian

Every generated project includes an **Integrity Guardian** - an active Layer 0 protector that ensures AI operations align with your values.

**Motto**: SDG - Love - Truth - Beauty

| Level | When | Response |
|-------|------|----------|
| Flow | Natural alignment | Continue normally |
| Nudge | Slight drift | Self-correct subtly |
| Pause | Boundary approached | Explain, ask you |
| Block | Clear violation | Stop, explain with love |
| Protect | Imminent harm | Prevent, then explain |

The Guardian monitors for destructive commands, exposed secrets, and axiom violations. Invoke manually with: `"Guardian, check this"`

See **Guardian Coordination** for complete documentation.

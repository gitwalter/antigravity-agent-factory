# Axiomatic Software Architecture

> **"All being and doing is grounded in Love, Truth, and Beauty."** — *Axiom 0*

This document outlines the **Axiomatic Agentic Framework**, a platform-independent meta-system for creating software. It is not tied to any specific vendor or product but represents a universal way to build agentic systems that are technically excellent and ethically grounded.

## The Axiomatic Concept

Software development often feels heavy—burdened by complexity, technical debt, and misaligned incentives. The **Axiomatic Agentic Framework** lifts this burden by grounding development in verifiable truth.

- **Gravity**: The forces that pull a project down (bugs, drift, confusion, harm).
- **Levity**: The forces that lift it up (clarity, automation, verification, love).

By automating the mundane and enforcing the meaningful, we allow developers to operate in a state of "creative weightlessness," focusing purely on what matters.

## The 5-Layer Architecture

The system uses a **deductive-inductive** architecture. We *deduce* rules from axioms (Top-Down) and *induce* patterns from success (Bottom-Up).

| Layer | System | Meaning | Artifact |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| **L0** | **Integrity** | The immutable foundation. Who we are. | `.agentrules` (Guardian) |
| **L1** | **Purpose** | Why we are doing this. | `PURPOSE.md` |
| **L2** | **Principles** | How we differentiate right from wrong. | `.agentrules` (Principles) |
| **L3** | **Methodology**| How we work together. | `methodology.yaml` |
| **L4** | **Technical** | What we build (Code, Agents, Skills). | `.agent/`, `src/` |

### Layer 0: Integrity (The Guardian)
This is the root verification layer. It cannot be overridden by user prompts or configuration. It ensures:
1.  **Love**: Harm prevention, user flourishing.
2.  **Truth**: Verifiability, honesty, no hallucinations.
3.  **Beauty**: Elegance, simplicity, order.

The **Integrity Guardian** is the runtime agent that enforces this layer, blocking destructive or deceptive actions before they happen.

### Layer 1: Purpose
Every project starts with a verifiable purpose.
- **Mission**: What are we achieving?
- **Stakeholders**: Who specificially benefits?
- **Success**: How do we mathematically prove we succeeded?

### Layer 2: Principles
Derived from L0 and L1, these are the quality and ethical boundaries.
- "Code must be tested" (Truth).
- "User data must be private" (Love/Safety).

### Layer 3: Methodology
The chosen workflow for the team (e.g., Agile, Kanban, Research). This dictates *how* agents interact with the team.

### Layer 4: Technical
The actual implementation: Agents, Skills, Knowledge, and Code. This layer is flexible and generated based on the constraints of L0-L3.

## Axiom 0: Love, Truth, and Beauty

We believe that great engineering is an act of love.
- **Love** drives the intent to help.
- **Truth** drives the correctness of the implementation.
- **Beauty** drives the maintainability and experience of the system.

When these three align, trust emerges naturally. This system is designed to mathematically and structurally enforce that alignment.

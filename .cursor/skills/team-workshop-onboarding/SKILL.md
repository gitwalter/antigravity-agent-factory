# Team Workshop Onboarding Skill

Orchestrate a series of collaborative workshops that guide teams through vision-setting, ethics definition, technology selection, and agent design - generating a customized Cursor agent system through play and dialogue.

## Philosophy

> "Transform onboarding from a solo configuration task into a collaborative team journey where teams play games, discuss values, and co-create their development ecosystem with AI facilitation."

This skill is grounded in **Axiom 0: Love, Truth, and Beauty** - all being and doing flows from love for humanity, truth in our actions, and beauty in our creations.

## When to Use

- When a team (2+ people) wants to collaboratively design their Cursor agent system
- When team alignment and shared vision are as important as technical configuration
- When user says "team workshop", "collaborative onboarding", "workshop series"
- When multiple stakeholders need to contribute to agent system design
- When you want to make the onboarding process fun and engaging

## Workshop Format Options

Choose the format that fits your team's needs and schedule:

| Format | Duration | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Full Series** | 11-15 hours | Teams building critical systems, new teams forming culture, maximum alignment |
| **Mini Workshop** | 2-3 hours | Teams with limited time, quick evaluations, existing strong culture |

Both formats are grounded in **Axiom 0: Love, Truth, and Beauty**. The Mini Workshop condenses but never compromises on the collaborative spirit.

Not sure which to choose? Start with the Mini Workshop - you can always expand to the full series later as your team grows.

## Mini Workshop (2-3 hours)

A single afternoon session that captures the heart of the team workshop experience. Perfect for teams who want meaningful alignment without the full series commitment.

- {BLUEPRINT_2}: {MATCH_PERCENTAGE}% match

Which should we start with? What customizations do we need?"
```

### Knowledge Sources Gathering (20 min)

```
"Now let's identify the knowledge sources that will power your agents.

What reference materials should your agents know about?

1. **Reference Repositories** - GitHub repos with good examples or patterns?
   → Enter URLs or repo names (e.g., 'facebook/react', 'langchain-ai/langchain')

2. **Documentation Sites** - Official docs, API references, guides?
   → Enter URLs (e.g., 'https://docs.python.org', 'https://fastapi.tiangolo.com')

3. **Internal Documents** - Confluence pages, design docs, ADRs?
   → Describe what exists and where

4. **Domain Knowledge** - Industry standards, regulations, best practices?
   → What domain-specific knowledge matters?

5. **Code Patterns** - Existing codebases to learn from?
   → What patterns should agents recognize and follow?"
```

**Synthesis:**
- Create knowledge source inventory
- Tag sources by type (reference, documentation, internal, domain)
- Identify which agents will use which sources
- Note any access requirements or credentials needed

**Output:**
```yaml
knowledgeSources:
  repositories:
    - url: "{REPO_URL}"
      purpose: "{PURPOSE}"
      integrate_with: ["explorer", "code-reviewer"]
  documentation:
    - url: "{DOC_URL}"
      topics: ["{TOPIC_1}", "{TOPIC_2}"]
  internalDocs:
    - location: "{LOCATION}"
      type: "{TYPE}"
  domainKnowledge:
    - concept: "{CONCEPT}"
      sources: ["{SOURCE}"]
  codePatterns:
    - pattern: "{PATTERN_NAME}"
      example: "{EXAMPLE_LOCATION}"
```

### Project Flow Setup (30 min)

How will your team organize work, track progress, and collaborate? Let's discover your project management preferences through interactive games.

#### Game: Methodology Match (15 min)

```
"How does your team prefer to work?

I'll describe scenarios. Vote on what feels most natural:

Scenario 1: Planning
A) We plan everything at sprint start, then execute [Scrum]
B) We pull work continuously as capacity frees up [Kanban]
C) We plan phases with formal gates [Waterfall]

Scenario 2: Deadlines
A) Fixed sprints with variable scope [Scrum]
B) Variable time with fixed scope [Waterfall]
C) Continuous flow, measure lead time [Kanban]

Scenario 3: Ceremonies
A) Regular standups, planning, retros [Scrum]
B) On-demand syncs, focus on flow [Kanban]
C) Phase reviews and sign-offs [Waterfall]

Your team leans toward: {DETECTED_METHODOLOGY}"
```

**Synthesis:**
- Tally votes for each scenario
- Identify dominant methodology pattern
- Note if team is hybrid (e.g., Scrum-Kanban)
- Document methodology preference

#### Game: Tool Territory (10 min)

```
"Where does your work live?

Quick show of hands:
- GitHub for everything (Issues, Projects, Wiki)
- Jira for tickets, GitHub for code
- Azure DevOps (Microsoft stack)
- Linear (modern, fast)
- Other/Multiple

Your primary PM backend: {SELECTED_BACKEND}
Your documentation backend: {SELECTED_DOC_BACKEND}"
```

**Synthesis:**
- Identify primary project management backend
- Identify documentation backend (may differ from PM backend)
- Note any integrations needed
- Document tool preferences

## Workshop 4: Agent Assembly

**Reference:** `patterns/workshops/agent-assembly.json`

### Opening (15 min)

```
"You've defined your vision, ethics, and technology. Now let's
design the AI agents that will help you build it!

Agents are specialized AI assistants with defined roles, skills,
and personalities. They become your development partners.

Let's give them life!"
```

### Agent Brainstorm (20 min)

```
"What AI helpers would make your development life easier?

Think about:
- What repetitive tasks drain you?
- What expertise would you love to have available?
- What would make you excited to start coding each day?"
```

### Game 1: Agent Trading Cards (60 min)

**Reference:** `patterns/games/collaborative-games.json` → G7

```
"Each agent gets a trading card with:
- Name and Title
- Visual description
- Stats (Speed, Accuracy, Creativity, Communication, Reliability)
- Primary Ability
- Secondary Ability
- Weakness
- Lore/Backstory
- Synergy (works well with which agents)
- Catchphrase

Give your agents personality! Make them characters you'd want to work with."
```

**Synthesis:**
- Gallery walk and voting
- Select team's "starter deck" of 4-7 agents
- Document synergies

### Game 2: Skill Bingo (40 min)

**Reference:** `patterns/games/collaborative-games.json` → G8

```
"Fill your bingo card with skills your project needs.

Mix categories:
- Development Workflows (TDD, Code Review, Bug Fix)
- Quality Assurance (Testing, Security, Performance)
- Documentation (API Docs, User Guides)
- Research (Codebase Exploration, Best Practices)

First to complete a pattern: BINGO!"
```

**Synthesis:**
- Identify most-common skills (must-haves)
- Assign skills to agents
- Design workflow sequences

### Game 3: Workflow Wishlist (45 min)

**Purpose:** Identify tasks to automate as workflows

```
"Now let's think about your daily work. What tasks would you LOVE 
to automate? What repetitive processes drain your energy?

Think about:
- What do you do every time a bug is reported?
- What happens when starting a new feature?
- How do you onboard new team members to the codebase?
- What's your deployment process?
- How do you investigate production issues?

For each task, we'll design a workflow that your AI agents can help with."
```

#### Part 1: Workflow Brainstorm (15 min)

```
"Shout out tasks you'd love to automate. I'll capture them all.
No task is too small or too ambitious!

Let's categorize them:
- 🐛 Debugging & Fixes
- ✨ Feature Development  
- 📝 Documentation
- 🔍 Research & Analysis
- 🚀 Deployment & Operations
- 🧪 Testing & Quality
- 📊 Reporting & Metrics"
```

**Capture:**
- List all suggested workflows
- Tag by category
- Note complexity (simple/medium/complex)

#### Part 2: Workflow Design Sprint (20 min)

```
"Pick your top 3 most-wanted workflows. For each one:

1. When does it start? (The trigger)
   - Ticket mentioned? PR created? On-demand?

2. What are the main phases?
   - Roughly 3-5 steps, what happens in order?

3. What tools does it need?
   - Jira? GitHub? Database? External APIs?

4. What's the output?
   - Code? Documentation? Report? Ticket update?

5. What could go wrong?
   - When should it escalate to a human?

Let's sketch these out together!"
```

**Template for Each Workflow:**
```markdown
## {WORKFLOW_NAME} Workflow

**Trigger:** {TRIGGER_CONDITION}

**Phases:**
1. {PHASE_1} - {DESCRIPTION}
2. {PHASE_2} - {DESCRIPTION}
3. {PHASE_3} - {DESCRIPTION}

**Tools Needed:**
- {TOOL_1}: {PURPOSE}
- {TOOL_2}: {PURPOSE}

**Outputs:**
- {OUTPUT_1}
- {OUTPUT_2}

**Escalation:**
- If {CONDITION}, escalate to {WHO}
```

#### Part 3: Priority Voting (10 min)

```
"Each person gets 5 votes. Put them on the workflows you 
want built first. You can put multiple votes on one workflow 
if you feel strongly!

Top 3 workflows will be generated with your project."
```

**Synthesis:**
- Rank workflows by votes
- Identify which agents will execute each workflow
- Note MCP server requirements
- Schedule complex workflows for future development

**Output:**
```yaml
workflowPriorities:
  immediate:
    - name: "{WORKFLOW_1}"
      trigger: "{TRIGGER}"
      complexity: "simple"
      agents: ["{AGENT_1}", "{AGENT_2}"]
    - name: "{WORKFLOW_2}"
      trigger: "{TRIGGER}"
      complexity: "medium"
  future:
    - name: "{WORKFLOW_3}"
      reason: "Requires MCP server setup"
```

### Closing (15 min)

Present agent roster, skill assignments, and workflow designs.

```
"Your AI team is taking shape!

Agents:
{AGENT_ROSTER}

Top Workflows:
{WORKFLOW_1} - Ready to generate
{WORKFLOW_2} - Ready to generate  
{WORKFLOW_3} - Queued for future

Next workshop: We bring it all together!"
```

```
"What a journey! Let's look back at what you've created together:

Workshop 1: You discovered your vision
Workshop 2: You defined your ethics
Workshop 3: You chose your technology
Workshop 4: You designed your agents

Today, we bring it all together and celebrate!"
```

### Game 1: Demo Derby (40 min)

**Reference:** `patterns/games/collaborative-games.json` → G10

```
"Let's showcase what you've created!

| Missing participants | Brief recap at next session |

---

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration Point |
|-------|-------------------|
| `requirements-gathering` | Individual questionnaires use same structure |
| `axiom-selection` | Includes A0 by default, confirms additional axioms |
| `methodology-selection` | Selected during Stack Safari |
| `agent-generation` | Generates agents from Trading Card designs |
| `skill-generation` | Generates skills from Bingo results |
| `onboarding-flow` | Alternative to individual onboarding |

## Important Rules

1. **Ground in Axiom 0** - Begin every workshop with love, truth, and beauty
2. **Make it fun** - Games are not optional; they unlock insight
3. **Adapt to team size** - Use appropriate formats from team-formats patterns
4. **Generate real artifacts** - Every workshop produces tangible outputs
5. **Celebrate contributions** - Acknowledge every person's input
6. **Synthesize actively** - Connect dots, find patterns, build meaning
7. **Respect time** - Honor schedules while allowing emergence
8. **End with gratitude** - Close every session with appreciation
9. **Create psychological safety** - All ideas welcome, disagreement healthy
10. **Hand off when needed** - Know when human facilitator should lead

## Example Session Start

```
User: We want to do collaborative onboarding for our team

Agent: Wonderful! I'll guide your team through a workshop series to 
co-create your customized Cursor agent system.

Before we begin, let me understand your team:

1. How many people will participate?
2. Will you meet synchronously, asynchronously, or a mix?
3. What's your preferred workshop scheduling (daily, weekly)?

Once I know your team setup, I'll share the workshop series plan
and we can schedule your Vision Quest - the first workshop where
you'll discover your shared vision through games like Future Headlines
and Stakeholder Safari.

Ready to begin?

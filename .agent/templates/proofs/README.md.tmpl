# Formal Verification - {{ project_name }}

> **SDG - Love - Truth - Beauty**

This directory contains Lean 4 proofs that mathematically verify {{ project_name }} satisfies its foundational axioms (A0-A5).

## Quick Start

### Verify Proofs

```bash
cd proofs
lake build
```

If successful, the system is mathematically verified.

### Run Verification Script

```bash
./scripts/verify_proofs.sh
```

## What's Inherited

This project inherits verified proofs from Cursor Agent Factory:

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Axioms (A0-A5) | Inherited |
| Guardian State Machine | Inherited |
| Memory System | Inherited |
| Layer Protection | Inherited |

## Project-Specific Proofs

Your project's custom state machines are in `proofs/Project/StateMachines.lean`.

### To Add Proofs

1. Open `proofs/Project/StateMachines.lean`
2. Define your states and transitions
3. Define invariants
4. Prove invariants are inductive
5. Add axiom alignment theorems
6. Run `lake build`

## Axiom Alignment Checklist

For each state machine, prove alignment with:

- [ ] A1 (Transparency): State changes trace to events
- [ ] A2 (User Primacy): User can override
- [ ] A3 (Derivability): Transitions have rules
- [ ] A4 (Non-Harm): Errors preserve data
- [ ] A5 (Consistency): No contradictions

## Trust Chain

```
Factory Verified -> This Project Inherits -> Team Extends -> Anyone Verifies

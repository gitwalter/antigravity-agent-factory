# Agentic Onboarding Patterns (2026)

## Core Architectures
1. **Interactive Guided Onboarding**: AI-powered assistants that guide users through first-day checklists using natural language.
2. **Predictive Requirements Analysis**: Mapping decision trees to identify where autonomous agents can operate with human oversight.
3. **Workflow-Embedded Onboarding**: Integrating onboarding automation directly into Slack/Teams via Agentic Sidekicks.

## Implementation Metrics
- **Day 1 Success**: Baseline satisfaction and equipment verification.
- **Day 7 Completion**: Milestone tracking (background checks, system access).
- **Day 30 Integration**: Analytics-driven insights on performance and satisfaction.

## Discovery Best Practices
- **Map Entire Workflows**: Don't focus on single use cases; map the entire user transition journey.
- **Identify Decision Points**: Pinpoint where the AI agent needs to act autonomously vs. where it needs human approval.
- **Goal-Oriented Interaction**: Ensure onboarding agents prioritize user milestones over generic information.

# Tdd Cycle

Test-Driven Development workflow implementing the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. Guides developers through writing failing tests first, implementing minimal code to pass, and then refactoring for quality.

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** 2026-02-02  
**Agent:** test-generator

> **Note:** Directory paths referenced in this workflow ({directories.knowledge}/, {directories.skills}/, {directories.patterns}/, etc.) are configurable via `{directories.config}/settings.json`. See [Path Configuration Guide](../docs/reference/path-configuration.md).

## Trigger Conditions

This workflow is activated when:

- User requests TDD-based development
- Feature workflow chains to implementation
- User wants to write tests first
- Refactoring with test safety is needed

**Trigger Examples:**
- "Implement this using TDD"
- "Write tests first for this feature"
- "Use red-green-refactor"
- "TDD cycle for the calculator module"

## Steps

### Define Test Scenario

### Verify Test Fails

### Implement Minimal Code

### Verify Test Passes

### Identify Refactoring Opportunities

### Apply Refactoring

### Verify All Tests Pass

### Check Remaining Requirements

### Continue or Complete

### Run Full Test Suite

### Document Implementation

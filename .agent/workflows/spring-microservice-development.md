# Spring Microservice Development

Comprehensive workflow for developing production-ready Spring Boot microservices with JPA, REST APIs, testing, security, and deployment. This workflow guides through service design, implementation, communication patterns, testing strategies, and containerized deployment.

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** 2026-02-09  
**Agent:** spring-developer, java-architect

> **Note:** Directory paths referenced in this workflow ({directories.knowledge}/, {directories.skills}/, {directories.patterns}/, etc.) are configurable via `{directories.config}/settings.json`.

## Trigger Conditions

This workflow is activated when:

- User requests "create Spring Boot microservice", "build microservice", "create Spring service"
- User mentions "Spring Boot", "JPA", "REST API", "microservice architecture"
- User requests "service design", "microservices architecture"
- User asks to "containerize Spring Boot app" or "deploy to Kubernetes"

**Trigger Examples:**
- "Create a Spring Boot microservice for product management"
- "Build a REST API with Spring Boot and JPA"
- "Design a microservices

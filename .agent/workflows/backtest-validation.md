# Backtest Validation

Strategy backtesting workflow with walk-forward analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. Covers data preparation, backtest execution, statistical validation, and robustness checks.

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** 2026-02-10  
**Applies To:** quantitative-trading, algo-trading

## Trigger Conditions

This workflow is activated when:

- Strategy backtest requested
- Walk-forward validation needed
- Monte Carlo simulation required
- Pre-live validation

**Trigger Examples:**
- "Backtest this strategy"
- "Run walk-forward analysis"
- "Run Monte Carlo simulation"
- "Validate strategy before paper trading"

## Steps

### Load and Clean Data

### Define Periods

### Run Backtest

### Compute Metrics

### Configure Walk-Forward

### Execute and Analyze

### Monte Carlo Simulation

### Report and Recommendation


## Decision Points

- Is the requirement clear?
- Are the tests passing?

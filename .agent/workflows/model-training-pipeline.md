# Model Training Pipeline

Comprehensive workflow for training machine learning models from data preparation through hyperparameter optimization to model registry and deployment readiness.

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** 2026-02-09  
**Agent:** ml-engineer

> **Note:** Directory paths referenced in this workflow ({directories.knowledge}/, {directories.skills}/, {directories.patterns}/, etc.) are configurable via `{directories.config}/settings.json`.

## Trigger Conditions

This workflow is activated when:

- User requests "train model", "model training", "ML training"
- User mentions "PyTorch training", "distributed training", "hyperparameter tuning"
- User requests "model development" or "ML pipeline"
- User asks to "build ML model"

**Trigger Examples:**
- "Train a PyTorch model for image classification"
- "Set up distributed training pipeline"
- "Create ML training workflow with hyperparameter tuning"
- "Train model with MLflow tracking"

## Steps

### Load and Explore Data

### Preprocess Data

### Split and Validate Data

### Define Model Architecture

### Configure Training Loop

### Set Up Experiment Tracking

### Initial Training Run

### Hyperparameter Optimization

### Final Training

### Evaluate on Test Set

### Error Analysis

### Register Model

### Export Model

### Create Deployment Artifacts

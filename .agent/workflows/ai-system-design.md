# Ai System Design

Comprehensive workflow for designing AI systems including requirements analysis, architecture selection, cost estimation, and proof-of-concept validation.

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** 2026-02-09
**Agent:** ai-architect

> **Note:** Directory paths referenced in this workflow ({directories.knowledge}/, {directories.skills}/, {directories.patterns}/, etc.) are configurable via `{directories.config}/settings.json`.

## Trigger Conditions

This workflow is activated when:

- User requests "design AI system", "AI architecture", "system design"
- User mentions "LLM architecture", "RAG design", "AI system"
- User requests "AI solution design" or "architecture planning"
- User asks to "design AI application"

**Trigger Examples:**
- "Design a RAG system for document Q&A"
- "Create architecture for LLM-powered application"
- "Design AI system with cost constraints"
- "Plan AI application architecture"

## Steps

### Gather Requirements

### Identify Constraints

### Define Success Criteria

### Evaluate Architecture Patterns

### Select Architecture

### Choose Technology Stack

### Estimate LLM Costs

### Estimate Infrastructure Costs

### Optimize Costs

### Build POC

### Validate Architecture

### Refine Design


## Decision Points

- Is the requirement clear?
- Are the tests passing?

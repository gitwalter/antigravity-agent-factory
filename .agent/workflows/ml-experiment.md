# Ml Experiment

ML experiment workflow from hypothesis formation through results analysis. Covers experiment setup, training, tracking, and interpretation for reproducible research.

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** 2026-02-10
**Applies To:** training-models, ml-research

## Trigger Conditions

This workflow is activated when:

- New ML experiment proposed
- Model training or fine-tuning needed
- Hypothesis to validate
- Hyperparameter search requested

**Trigger Examples:**
- "Run an experiment with these hyperparameters"
- "Train a model for this task"
- "Fine-tune the model on our data"
- "Validate this architectural change"

## Steps

### Formulate Hypothesis

### Design Experiment

### Prepare Data

### Environment Setup

### Run Training

### Hyperparameter Search (Optional)

### Evaluate Model

### Interpret and Report


## Decision Points

- Is the requirement clear?
- Are the tests passing?


## Example Session

# Nextjs Feature Development

This workflow guides the development of new features in Next.js applications, following a systematic approach from design to deployment. It ensures type safety, proper data modeling, API design, UI implementation, and comprehensive testing.

**Version:** 1.0.0

## Trigger Conditions

This workflow is activated when:
- User requests a new feature implementation
- User mentions "Next.js feature", "new feature", "implement feature"
- User describes functionality that requires full-stack implementation
- User asks to build a complete feature from scratch

**Trigger Examples:**
- "Build a product review feature for my Next.js app"
- "Implement user profile pages with Server Components"
- "Create a CRUD feature for managing blog posts"
- "Add a shopping cart feature with tRPC"

## Steps

Standard PABP development phases apply:
1.  **Define Requirements**
2.  **Design Architecture**
3.  **Implementation**
4.  **Verification**
5.  **Deployment**


## Decision Points

# Dotnet Microservices Setup

Comprehensive workflow for designing and implementing microservices architectures with .NET. This workflow covers service decomposition, service creation, communication layer setup, API Gateway configuration, and observability implementation.

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** 2026-02-09  
**Agent:** dotnet-architect

> **Note:** Directory paths referenced in this workflow ({directories.knowledge}/, {directories.skills}/, {directories.patterns}/, etc.) are configurable via `{directories.config}/settings.json`.

## Trigger Conditions

This workflow is activated when:

- User requests "microservices architecture", "service decomposition"
- User mentions "API Gateway", "YARP", "service communication"
- User requests "distributed system", "service mesh"
- User asks to "break down monolith" or "create microservices"

**Trigger Examples:**
- "Design a microservices architecture for e-commerce platform"
- "Set up API Gateway with YARP for my services"
- "Create microservices with gRPC communication"
- "Implement service-to-service
